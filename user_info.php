            Below are key points explaining where we are as a company and why we are in the best possible position to be the most significant player in the electronic payment arena.  We have positioned our company and products to meet the needs and demands that face the retail and e-comers merchants. We have seen tremendous interest in our Apple iPhone application and RIMM Blackberry application for processing of credit and offline debit cards with a potential to process an additional 18,000,000 new merchants in the United States.

            The Company is well positioned and is relevant as it enters into its growth stage. The Company is seeking $5,000,000 as growth capital that is needed to become profitable within  12-18 months. The proceeds of this capital will be allocated for continued working capital &amp; operations, increase independent sales representatives &amp; marketing exposures and to begin the merchant cash advance program. Our plan for the CMS-POS equipment (CMS-integrated electronic cash register) segment is designed to offer systems for sale and/or lease our POS equipment through our in house financing program (Merchant Cash Advance) or third party leasing. This provides a financial model that takes the large equipment outlay, ownership expense and transfers it to monthly manageable costs that are influenced by transactions processed by the merchant. Our plans on the CMS-POS segment is to partner with large supermarket and fast food franchisors and distribute our equipment and processing services to their franchisees.<br />

            <br />
            â€¢ The Company and its subsidiaries are launching an aggressive nationwide Independent  Representative recruiting campaign with Carrier Builders and USA Today over the next 12 months that is expected to add hundreds or possibly thousand of new Representatives. These Representatives will go through a complete company training that will certify our representatives on our processing platform.<br />
            <br />
            â€¢ Market conditions are perfect for our products and services due to changes in the economy and a high unemployment. In 2007 though 2009 tens of thousands of companies went out of business and or scaled back laying of millions of people. This has caused an opportunity to go after new businesses that are forming due to lack of employment opportunities. These conditions will also help the Company in its recruiting efforts.<br />
